<h3>This directory contains the pairs of proteins known to interact, which three-dimensional structures have been reported experimentally as well as predicted by AlphaFold2.</h3>
<p></p>The pairs of experimental structures are included in files starting with the name <b>"exp_"</b> and include the PDB and chain for every protein.</p>
<p></p>The pairs of AlphaFold structures are included in files starting with the name <b>"af_"</b> and include the UniProt ID for every protein.</p>
<p>The distance used to build the contact map is specified in the file name as d7 for 7 Angstroms or d8 for 8 Angstroms.</p>
<p>The inclusion or not of the sidechain in building the contact map is reported in the file name with <b>Lat</b> or <b>NoLat</b>, respectively.</p>
