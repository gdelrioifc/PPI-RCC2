<h3>This directory includes the files used to study the angles and parallelisms among pairs of <i>RCC</i> derived from non-interacting proteins.</h3>
<p>Files with "af_" corresponds with pairs of non-interating proteins associated with AlphaFold models.</p>

<p>Files with "exp_" corresponds with pairs of non-interating proteins associated with Experimental models.</p>

<p>Files with "d7" or "d8" corresponds with RCC calculated using 7 and 8 Angstroms, respectively.</p>

<p>Files with "Lat" or "NoLat" corresponds with RCC calculated using or not the atoms side chains, respectively.</p>
