# PPI-RCC2
Supplementary Material for "Residue Cluster Classes in Protein-Protein Interactions" in "Aggregates &amp; Clusters of Amino Acids. Properties and biochemical consequences"

In this site you will find the training and testing datasets used to evaluate 3 different models previously reported by our group to efficiently classify protein-protein interactions (PPI) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640745/">(1)</a>.

The training sets are included in the <a href="">Training</a> directory. The testing sets are included in the <a href="">Testing</a> directory. Both sets are included in the ARFF file format useable by <a href="https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/">Weka</a>.

The Weka models trained to predict PPI are included in <a href="">Models</a> directory. These files are in a binary format readable by Weka.
